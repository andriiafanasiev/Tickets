				Investments, Inc., Universal Music Group Holdings, Inc., Universal Music Group, Inc., UMG Commercial
				Services, Inc., and Universal Music Publishing, Inc. participate in the EU-US Data Privacy Framework,
				the Swiss-US Data Privacy Framework, and the UK Extension to the EU-US Data Privacy Framework
				(collectively the "DPF") regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information
				transferred to the United States from member countries of the European Economic Area, Switzerland, and
				the United Kingdom. UMG has certified to the United Stated Department of Commerce that we adhere to the
				Data Privacy Framework Principles. More information about the Data Privacy Framework, including UMG's
				certification, is available on the Data Privacy Framework (DPF) Program website.</p>
			<p>Our group companies are subject to the investigatory and enforcement powers of the United States Federal

				event giving rise to the damage.</p>
			<p>Individuals whose data is subject to the DPF have the right to access personal information about them.
				You may also have choices to limit the use, and disclosure of personal information about you. Please see

				back frequently to see any updates or changes to our privacy policy.</p>

			<h2>DIGITAL ADVERTISING</h2>
			<p>We use third party partners to enable targeted advertising on third-party social media platforms,
				websites, and mobile apps. These companies collect information through our Apps to target users and
				serve ads. Some of these ads may be personalized, meaning that these ads are intended to be relevant to
				you based on information the companies collect or receive about your use of our App and third-party
				sites and apps over time, including through the use of cookies and other tracking technologies.</p>
			<p>Visit the DAA Webchoices tool at www.aboutads.info to learn more about targeted advertising and how to

				choices exercised through the DAA Webchoices tool.</p>
			<p>To opt-out of targeted advertising in mobile apps by companies participating in the DAA's AppChoices
				program, you can download that app onto your device from https://youradchoices.com/appchoices. You can
				also limit data collection and use by third parties for targeted advertising in your mobile device
				settings, where available.</p>
			<p>Note that electing to opt out will not stop advertising from appearing in your browser or applications.
				It may make the ads you see less relevant to your interests.</p>

			<h2>COOKIES</h2>
			<p>Our Apps use cookies and other similar technologies to improve your experience and support targeted
				advertising. For the purpose of this Cookies Policy, cookies, and other similar technologies (like
				scripts, plug-ins, tags, device fingerprints, Local Stored Objects, beacons, and pixels) are all
